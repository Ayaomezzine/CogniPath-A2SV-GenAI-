## Detailed description of our Generative AI models

* **Essay correction:** The student puts their handwritten paragraph into the website, chooses an image, and enters the number of lines in their paragraph. Then, they click on "Recognize" to display a textarea with the handwritten image on the right. The user has the possibility to manually change the paragraph if the handwritten OCR (microsoft/trocr-large-handwritten) did not catch the words correctly. When they click on "Correct," they will receive a table that contains the pros and cons of the paragraph, generated by OpenAI: GPT3.5-fast, as well as suggestions for how to improve their writing skills. Text to speech (SpeechSynthesisUtterance with a male voice) is also included to make the experience more interactive.
* **Emotion recognition:** The student chooses a phrase, each of which has an emotion significance. When they click on the phrase and then the "Magic Button," an image will be generated to express the emotion of the phrase. This feature is really important because people with disabilities have many difficulties with emotion recognition. We use the image generation model stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 for this feature.
* **Storyfy Feature:** We developed a new feature called "Storyfy" that allows users to input a word or a complex paragraph, and the system generates a kid-friendly story based on the input by OpenAI: GPT3.5-fast. This feature includes text to speech (SpeechSynthesisUtterance with a male voice) integration and image generation for an interactive storytelling experience.
* **Chatbot:** The chatbot is a powerful tool in which we used botpress that can help students with ASD in a number of ways. It can provide students with support and guidance, answer their questions, and help them to develop coping mechanisms.

## How Generative AI Models are Solving the Problem

Generative AI models are solving the problem of helping students with mental illness like ASD in a number of ways.

* **Essay correction:** Generative AI models can help students with mental illness by providing them with feedback on their essays. This can help students to identify areas where they need to improve their writing skills, and to make their writing more clear, concise, and engaging.
* **Emotion recognition:** Generative AI models can help students with mental illness to better understand their own emotions, and the emotions of others. This can be helpful for social skills development, and for managing stress and anxiety.
* **Storyfy:** Generative AI models can help students with mental illness to develop their creativity and imagination. This can be helpful for self-expression, and for developing coping mechanisms for dealing with mental illness.
* **Chatbot:** The chatbot can provide students with support and guidance, answer their questions, and help them to develop coping mechanisms.


Generative AI models are a powerful tool that can be used to help students with mental illness in a number of ways. By providing students with feedback on their writing, helping them to better understand emotions, and developing their creativity, generative AI models can help students to thrive in school and in life.
